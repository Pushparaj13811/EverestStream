## TMDB API Configuration

To use the **TMDB API**, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up on [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Navigate to your account settings and find the **API section**.
3. Generate an API key.
4. Add the API key to your `.env` file as mentioned in the setup process.

## How It Works

1. **Home Page**: Users can view trending movies and TV shows fetched from TMDB.
2. **Movie/TV Show Details**: Clicking on a movie or TV show brings up detailed information, including:
   - Title, Description, Release Date, and Rating
   - Cast and Crew details
   - Official videos such as trailers and teasers
3. **Recommended Movies/TV Shows**: Below the details section, users can find similar or recommended content based on the selected movie or TV show.
